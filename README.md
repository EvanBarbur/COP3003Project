# Project Title

My project is a small program with a collection of games to play. These game include Rock-Paper Scissors, TicTacToe, and Connect Four. This project was created by me, Evan Barbur, and I made it independently. I have worked on this project the last couple of weeks for a COP3003 class assignment at Florida Gulf Coast University. I have some experiecne in coding but mainly from what I've learned in school. I don't have much practice outside of school-releated programming.
