# Project Title

My project is a small program with a collection of games to play. These game include Rock-Paper Scissors, TicTacToe, and Connect Four. This project was created by me, Evan Barbur, and I made it independently. I have worked on this project the last couple of weeks for a COP3003 class assignment at Florida Gulf Coast University. I have some experiecne in coding but mainly from what I've learned in school. I don't have much practice outside of school-releated programming.

## Demonstration

## Documentation
For Python, use the output of your docstrings. For other languages, create a docs folder in your project. If using Java, generate JavaDoc in your IDE. If using C++, use Doxygen. Change repository settings (using Settings at top of page) to use GitHub Pages with your docs folder. Add a link to the javadoc/doxygen index.html file with this markdown: [Text to appear](URL)
The URL will be YourGitHubUserName.github.io/YourRepositoryName/foldername/filename
Do not include the docs folder name in your URL.
Sample: [JavaDoc](https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html)

## Diagrams
Such as a class diagram.
The markdown is ![Alt text](relative/path/to/img.png)
For example, this image 9919.png is saved to the docs folder in my repository and the markdown is ![Sample Image](docs/9919.png)
